	A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a finite set of 		arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the 		computer can solve more than one kind of problem.Conventionally, a computer consists of at 		least one processing element, typically a
	<a href="CPU.html"  target ="main_sub">centraL processing unit (CPU)</a>
	and some form of memory.The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and 	a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored 			information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and 		the result of operations saved and retrieved.The first electronic digital computers were 		developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States. Originally they were 		the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers 		(PCs).[1] In this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications.
