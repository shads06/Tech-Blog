	A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a finite set of 		arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the 		computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
	<BR>Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a
	<A HREF="CPU.html" target ="_blank">centraL processing unit (CPU)</A> and some form of memory. 	The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and 		control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral 		devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations 	saved and retrieved.

Computers can be generally classified by size and power as follows, though there is considerable overlap:

<UL><LI>Personal computer: A small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor.
<LI>Workstation: A powerful, single-user computer.
<LI> A workstation is like a personal computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and, in general, a higher-quality monitor.
<LI>Minicomputer: A multi-user computer capable of supporting up to hundreds of users simultaneously.
<LI>Supercomputer: An extremely fast computer that can perform hundreds of millions of instructions per second.</UL>

It is a midsize computer. In the past decade, the distinction between large minicomputers and small mainframes has blurred, however, as has the distinction between small minicomputers and workstations. But in general, a minicomputer is a multiprocessing system capable of supporting from up to 200 users simultaneously.
